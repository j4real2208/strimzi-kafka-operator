.Upgrade without downtime

For topics configured with high availability (replication factor of at least 3 and evenly distributed partitions), the upgrade process should not cause any downtime for consumers and producers.

The upgrade triggers rolling updates, where brokers are restarted one by one at different stages of the process. 
During this time, overall cluster availability is temporarily reduced, which may increase the risk of message loss in the event of a broker failure.
